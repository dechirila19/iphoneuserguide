      <p>Open the app with the compass icon... this is Safari, the web browser that comes with your phone.</p>
      <p>On the top bar is where the web address will be. You can click on this, type what you want to search and click enter to browse the web. At the bottom you will have your back <code>button</code> and forward <code>button</code> like on any browser.

       <h2 id="camera-s">Camera</h2></header>
      
      <p>Open the Camera app. It's hard to miss since it has the Camera icon. There is a lot packed in here. Lets start off with the top. On the top you'll have your "Flash" choice where you can turn flash on or off or leave it on auto. Next, the arrow in the middle changes the bottom bar from the different camera modes to another bar that has your choice of flash, LIVE photos, your timer, photo <code>size</code> and filters. Now back to the top bar, you'll have your "Live Photos" icon in the upper right which will let you choose if you want to take live photos or not.</p>
      <p>The bottom bar has all the different Camera modes. You can choose from Time-Lapse, Slo-Mo, Video, Photo, Portrait, and Pano (short for Panorama). Then on the lower left corner you'll have a small preview from the last photo you took. Click on it and you can scroll through the gallery of photos. The button underneath the bar on the bottom is your shutter button which you will click on to take a photo. The last icon to the right of it is the "Switch" button which allows you toggle between using the front-facing or back-facing camera. </p>
